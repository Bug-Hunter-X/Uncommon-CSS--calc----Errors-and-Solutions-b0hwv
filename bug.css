The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if you use it incorrectly, it can lead to unexpected behavior or errors. For example, using incorrect units or missing spaces between operators and values can cause the calculation to fail.  Another common issue is trying to perform operations that CSS `calc()` does not support, like modulo operations (%) or bitwise operations.
